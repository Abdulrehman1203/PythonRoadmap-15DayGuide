# 15-Days Complete Python Roadmap

## Introduction
Welcome to the **15-Days Complete Python Roadmap**! This guide is designed to help you master Python in two weeks, focusing on both fundamentals and intermediate-level concepts. Each day provides a new learning module, practical exercises, and hands-on projects to ensure a thorough understanding of Python programming.

## Who is this for?
- **Beginners**: New to programming or Python? This roadmap offers a structured approach to grasp the basics.
- **Intermediate Learners**: If you already know some Python, this will deepen your knowledge and introduce you to advanced topics.
- **Developers**: Perfect for developers preparing for Python-based projects, coding interviews, or expanding their skill set.

## Roadmap Overview

### Week 1: Python Foundations, Data Structures, and Algorithms

- **Day 1: Introduction to Python and Control Structures**
    - Install Python and set up the development environment (VS Code, PyCharm)
    - Explore basic syntax, variables, and data types
    - Work with conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
    - Use loops (`for`, `while`) for iteration

- **Day 2: Functions**
    - Define and invoke functions, understand arguments and return values
    - Explore built-in modules (`math`, `datetime`, `os`, `json`)
    - Create and utilize custom modules

- **Day 3: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, and String Manipulation**
    - Manipulate lists and tuples, including sorting and list comprehension
    - Work with dictionaries for key-value pairs, explore set operations
    - Handle string operations: slicing, formatting

- **Day 4: Basic Algorithms**
    - Implement and understand basic sorting (e.g., bubble sort) and searching (e.g., linear search, binary search) algorithms

- **Day 5: Practical Application**
    - **Exercise 1**: Develop a basic calculator for arithmetic operations
    - **Exercise 2**: Write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year
    - **Exercise 3**: Merge two lists, remove duplicates, and sort the result
    - **Exercise 4**: Create a function that counts the frequency of each character in a string

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Python Concepts

- **Day 1: Classes, Objects, Inheritance**
    - Define classes, create objects, and implement methods (types of methods)
    - Understand inheritance, including method overriding and multiple inheritance

- **Day 2: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction**
    - Apply polymorphism in practical scenarios
    - Implement encapsulation and abstract classes

- **Day 3: Exception Handling and File Handling**
    - Implement error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally`
    - Create custom exceptions
    - Read from and write to files, including CSV and JSON processing

- **Day 4: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators**
    - Create and use iterators and generators for efficient data handling
    - Understand and implement function decorators for code enhancement

- **Day 5: Practical Application**
    - **Exercise 1**: Design a `BankAccount` class with deposit, withdrawal, and balance check methods
    - **Exercise 2**: Develop a vehicle hierarchy using inheritance (e.g., Car, Truck)
    - **Exercise 3**: Write a program to read and process data from a CSV file
    - **Exercise 4**: Create a decorator to log the execution time of functions

## How to Use This Roadmap
- Follow the plan day by day to complete each topic and exercise.
- Practice coding regularly to reinforce concepts.
- Refer to the additional resources provided in each module.
